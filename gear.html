            <p class="p">
                These are the setups I would recommend for new and experienced river bank fishers alike. I'll have a brief description
                of each item and my recommendations for paired gear.
            </p>
            <h3>Rods</h3>
            <p class="p">
                I've always been fond of spinning gear myself and recommend beginners to start with it. Each rod will be made for either
                spinning or casting reels. It is important to pair the appropriate rod with it's corresponding reel to have proper operation
                of both. Spinning reels are ideal for bank fishing on big rivers and have been gaining in popularity over the past few years.
                A spinning reel faces downward and sits naturally in-between an anglers fingers when holding the rod. Spinning reels also
                come in a variety of sizes and the largest of them have copious line capacity for big river bank fishing. They also generally
                allow for further casting then other types of reels. It's for these reasons that I prefer them and will show you my favorite
                options here. Remember though, a rod and a reel are only a part of the equation. I'll also have links to tackle that I recommend.

                    Okuma has been a brand I have grown fond of within the past few years. I have found great success with their products
                    and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a quality rod or reel. The Okuma Battle Cat rod is one
                    of the heavy hitters that goes unnoticed by many anglers. It's incredibly reliable and strong, offering support through
                    the whole rod via double foot welded eyelet guides and a solid spine. The tip of the rod is very sensitive and works very
                    well with circle hooks. The rod is capable of hauling in monster river catfish and pond kitties alike. Though it's one of
                    the most expensive options, it is a great example of getting what you pay for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strongly recommend pairing this with an Okuma Avenger Spinning Reel or PENN Pursuit III Spinning Reel (6000 or 8000 class) and running 50-65lb braided main line with a
                    30-50lb monofilament or fluorocarbon leader. If you want to use it in smaller creeks or to target smaller fish, try putting on a
                    12lb monofilament or fluorocarbon leader. This rod is made to master circle hooks, so I would recommend using them. Use a hook that 
                    will be a good fit for the size fish you're targeting (less then 10lbs - 3/0-5/0 | over 10lbs - 6/0-8/0). Use as much weight
                    as you need to keep bait down and keep the line tight while under water. I'll have an article up about gear pairing in the future.

                    Ugly Stik has been around for a long time and has developed a reputation of reliable and seemingly unbreakable rods.
                    The Ugly Stik Catfish Spinning Rod is an 8' rod capable of hauling in many river monsters back to back. A rugged and
                    reliable option for bank and boat fishermen. It's capable of handling big river gear with room to spare. A strong spine
                    and all the features that has made Ugly Stik a name known for quality are here in this rod. Slightly cheaper then the Okuma
                    mentioned above, the only challenge I can foresee from the bank is casting range, but paired with the right gear, weight
                    and with practice, that can be negated.

                    If your interested in big river fishing but don't want to drop a lot of money into it, this rod is worth trying out.
                    Berkley products have been around for a long time and offer quality and reliability without sacrificing affordability.
                    This rod is capable of big river fishing and hauling in trophy catfish. It's 8' long and offers all the features you need
                    for hunting big fish. The only concern is casting distance, but like the Ugly Stik before this, that can be made up for with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recommend pairing this with an Okuma Avenger Spinning Reel or a similar spinning reel in the 6000 or 8000 class and running 50-65lb braided main line with a
                    30-50lb monofilament or fluorocarbon leader. This rod is capable of using circle hooks, so I would recommend using them. Use a hook and line weight that 
                    will be a good fit for the size fish you're targeting (less then 10lbs - 3/0-5/0 circle hook and 12lb test monofilament leader line | over 10lbs - 6/0-8/0 circle hooks and the line mentioned). Use as much weight
                    as you need to keep bait down and keep the line tight while under water.

            <h3>Reels</h3>
            <p class="p">
                I've already covered why I recommend spinning reels for bank fishermen, so i won't go into great detail on that. As for what
                spinning reels to invest in, there are a few options that I prefer and some that stand out from the crowd as top in class.
                I'll make a short list of those that I recommend below.

                    PENN fishing reels are some of the best in class. They aren't terribly expensive and offer quality machining for years
                    of reliability. PENN reels are often used by saltwater anglers and have become very popular with freshwater catfish anglers
                    in recent years because of their rugged and reliable nature. When paired with a quality rod, you will be able to dominate the 
                    big rivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would recommend using braid with this reel sense it is braid ready out of the box. My preference is always the mid-heavy main line weight
                    of 30-65lbs when using braid. As for the leader line, I would go with a 30-50lb monofilament or fluorocarbon line.

                    This Sougayilang Reel is a wonder among the river anglers who have seen it in action. Don't be fooled by the price, this
                    reel will fight with the best of them and haul in river monsters left and right. To add to it's wonder, it offers a bait feeder
                    system with an adjustable secondary drag. They packed a lot of features into this reel for the price, but it seems that quality
                    was not sacrificed on any part. If your the adventurous type, you should give this reel a go!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would run braid on this reel. It has a good capacity but you'll need to back the reel with monofilament first and then tie on braid.
                    The reel might be fine to run without a backing, but I couldn't find any explicit information on that. I wouldn't hesitate 
                    to run pure monofilament either.

                    The KastKing is an established favorite of many anglers. It offers a number of high quality features and comes out of the box
                    ready to go. It also has an industry leading 39.5lb carbon fiber drag system that's able to hold up against the mightiest of 
                    river monsters. The only concern I have is long term durability, which has mixed reviews.

                <p>
                    I would run braid on this reel. It has the lowest capacity out of the three shown, but it's also braid ready out of
                    the box. I would put 45-65lb braid as the main line and pair it with a 30-50lb monofilament or fluorocarbon leader line.

                    Berkley makes a fantastic and relatively affordable fluorocarbon line. This line is said to reflect light much the same 
                    as water, making it near invisible under water. It handles better then monofilament when exposed to water over long periods 
                    of time as well.

                    RUNCL PowerFluoro takes advantage of the properties of fluorocarbon while using a copolymer core. This line boasts the
                    same benefits as pure fluorocarbon and the reviews seem to support that claim. It's a bit more affordable then pure fluorocarbon,
                    so it might be worth looking into if your running a budget.

                    It's not the highest quality line on the market, but it's the budget king and get my "good enough" award. I love this line, I've used it for years and never had
                    any issues with it. In terms of monofilament, it's very smooth and abrasion resistant compared to others I've used. It makes 
                    a great leader line or even mainline if your on a budget.

            <h3>Hooks</h3>
            <p class="p">
                Circle hooks are king on the river. They are self-setting hooks that hold bait very well and are designed to hook a fish's lips.
                This is great for catch and release fishing because the fish is almost never fatally harmed by the hook set. These hooks are also 
                used by food fishermen because they have a great hookup ratio and fish almost never come off if properly hooked. One of the biggest
                lessons I've learned about hooks, you get what you pay for. They don't cost a ton, but you'll be sad if you use the cheap stuff.

                <p>
                    Gamakatsu is a quality brand trusted by fishermen everywhere. Their 8/0 circle hooks have never failed me and have 
                    proven to be a high quality option. The hooks are made from high quality steel and hold a point better then any of
                    the budget options available.

                Though I couldn't find any links on Amazon, another hook I have come to trust and love is the Team Catfish 8/0 circle hooks
                sold at Walmart. These hooks are high quality and very strong. I've never had any issues with them and their bent eye makes 
                tying a snell knot easy.

            <h3>Cast net</h3>
            <p class="p">
                A cast net is one of the most important things a catfish angler needs in their inventory. A cast net allows you to get bait
                with a throw of the arm, though they take a bit of practice to get used to and cast well. I've personally never needed one 
                larger then 3 1/2' wide, but there are times where one a little larger would have been helpful. Anything larger then 5' wide 
                can be a bit unwieldy from the bank, so I wouldn't go much further then that. Walmart sells cast nets in certain areas and 
                some can be found on amazon, though I have never used any of the ones from amazon myself.

                <p>
                    I can't speak for the quality of the net myself, but the reviews were very good and the price is right for high quality.
                    Best Fisher's is a name I've seen used by many other river anglers as well.

                Outside of the gear shown here, other things you'll want to get include barrel swivels, lead sliding sinkers and sinker stops.
                I'll be sure to add links to good examples later on. For the swivels, go for 1/0 size. For the weights, egg or no-roll sinkers are
                a good choice ranging from 4-8oz. Be sure to get a variety between those sizes. I'm fond of rubber sinker stops. Be sure to put them 
                in front of your weight so it doesn't damage your swivel knots.
