            <p class="p">
                Nothing beats hauling a big catfish out of the river on a hot summer day, or any time of year really. I still remember
                the day I caught my first fish out of the river. I'd been walking the bank all day and had finally found a quiet 
                little corner to sit down and rest in before I packed up for the long walk back to my truck. The water was slow in this
                spot, barley showing a current. Little did I realize at the time, but I found a nice bank spot that would provide many 
                fish for months to come. I was set up right behind a dyke and next to a feeder creek or tributary. There was a small 
                opening behind the dyke and swirling water at that point. Tired, I had decided that I would make my last attempt here.
            </p>
            <div class="img-cont">

            </div>
            <p class="p">
                I baited two 8/0 circle hooks with cut carp on Carolina rigs that were held down by 5oz of lead each, more than enough 
                for this quiet hole. After about 15 minuets, I was just getting ready to pull my lines in when one of my rods bend and
                starts to make it's way out of my shabby rob holder. With a quick dash I managed to grab it before it was claimed by
                the river and felt the pull of a giant! Moments later, I landed my first flathead catfish. Not quiet
                the giant I thought he was, but a welcome prize all the same for a days worth of work.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="p">
                Looking back, I can see why this spot was a success when the others I tried that day weren't. All the conditions were
                right. The sun was past it's climax, the slow water hit the fast water creating swirls, a feeder creek full of shad was
                right next to me and it was right behind a rocky dyke. I didn't realize this was a recipe for success at the time. No
                river fishes the same, but in general, these conditions will provide ideal habitat for many fish in the river.

            <p class="p">
                I'll attempt to cover three basic points to consider before you make your madden voyage to a big river.
                The first thing I'll talk about is habitat, what to look for and why to look for it. Second will be my minimum gear
                recommendations and some ideas on how to use it. Last of all, I'll discuss big river safety. The big rivers, especially 
                in Missouri, are unforgiving to those who go unprepared and unwitting.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underline">Fruitful Habitat</h3>
            <p class="p">
                Without getting into the fine details (that'll be for another article), I'm going to highlight some things to look for
                in a river fishing spot.
            </p>
            <h4 class="underline">Slow water behind cover</h4>
            <p class="p">
                Though it may be tempting to go and cast a line into the main channel of the river, and though you may find success doing
                so on occasion, you'll find that more fish make their way into slower flowing areas on the river such as the mouths of
                feeder creeks or behind structure that blocks the current of the main channel. I haven't quite pinned down any reasons 
                for this definitively, but I assume as of now that there's simply more food to be had in these areas. I also imagine 
                that the fish seek refuge from the battering of the main current, or at least the small ones that get eaten. The last 
                thing to mention, it's also much easier to fish these slower areas then the main channel. The main channel of the Missouri
                River is especially fast and volatile and it takes a significant amount of weight to keep any bait down in one spot.
            </p>
            <h4 class="underline">Near feeder creeks and under log-jams</h4>
            <p class="p">
                Feeder creeks are also a great area to focus attention, especially during the late spring and into the summer months.
                It's this time of year that the water level is generally up and as the water level rises in these creeks, so too does
                the attention big fish give them. Flathead catfish and channel catfish can be found swimming up these creeks taking
                advantage of the new supply of food offered to them. It's not uncommon to find carp and freshwater drum doing the same.
                As these fish go into the creeks, large blue catfish can be found at the mouths, especially if the slow water clashes with
                the fast current and creates "swirls". If there are a bunch of tress creating a log-jam at the mouth of the feeder creek,
                catfish will be found under them. The hard part is getting your bait under the logs without snagging your line.
            </p>
            <h4 class="underline">On rocky structures</h4>
            <p class="p">
                One place that's overlooked by many is a rocky bank or random rocky structures. Those it's not my go-to move, I have found
                placing baits along long rocky banks has yielded fish as well. As the current batters against the rocks, it gets displaced
                and breaks up, leaving large sections of water with slower flow. Food for fish accumulates along these rocky breaks and
                a well placed bait will be found by one scouring them. Carp and catfish seem to be especially fond of these areas on the 
                Missouri River.
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline">Gear up</h3>
            <p class="p">
                I'll also make an article going more in depth on this topic, but this will be a basic overview of big river equipment.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Like I said earlier, every river is a bit different and no two fish the same, but there are general things to look for
                and general gear to use. If your fishing a big river with a heavy current, you're going to need gear that can take it.
                A long fishing rod can also be very useful if your bank bound like myself (for now). A longer rod will allow you to get
                further reach, but it also needs to be able to handle the weight that you'll use to keep your bait down. On the Missouri
                River, this is generally anywhere between 4-8oz. I'll have some good rods linked in the gear page if you're curious.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Along with a rod, you'll need a quality reel. When your fishing the big rivers, you'll need reels that can not only handle
                the weight and force of a fight, but also stand up to long term exposure and use. A reel in the 6500 or 8000 class would
                be ideal. I'm fond of Okuma reels myself, but there are many options to choose from. There is a bit of a debate between
                spinning reels and casting reels for river use, but ultimately you should chose what your comfortable with. I find 
                spinning reels a bit easier to use, but you can generally reach further with a good casting reel if you can learn to use one.
                Again, I'll have links in the gear page to some I would recommend.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                A rod and a reel will still do you no good without fishing line. This is another widely debated point in the fishing
                community. There are three primary types of line, all with their own advantages and disadvantages. The first and most
                common line is Monofilament. This is the cheapest of the fishing lines. It has a bit of stretch to it and tends to do
                fair around rocky environments. It's also very thick compared to other lines and often picks up current and wind.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Fluorocarbon is another type of fishing line that has gained a lot of popularity. It's got less stretch then monofilament and tends 
                to do better around rocks and sharp edges, though nothing is really great around sharp edges. It sinks in the water well,
                but this is almost negated by the use of the heavy weights on the river. It costs quite a bit more then monofilament but
                offers a solid hookset with minimal stretch.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                The last is braided fishing line. This is a very expensive line but it has
                unique properties compared to the other two lines. Braid has almost no memory, in other words, it bends very easy and
                doesn't maintain a shape. Braided line is also very thin when put side by side with mono or fluoro of the same weight class.
                Braid cuts through water and air better then the other two as well, reducing the amount of weight needed to keep baits down
                by a bit. I personally use braid for my main line and tie on a mono or flouro leader line attached to my hooks. More on that
                in a latter article.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                What type of line or combination of lines you choose to use will effect the rest of your gear as well. Braid, for example,
                has a habit of cutting through plastic eyelets and damaging reels that don't have a backing of some sort. Mono will require
                a bit more weight to keep down in some cases and has more stretch, making reliable hook sets a bit more challenging, but this
                is also offset when you use very sharp and strong hooks (something I recommend very much). Ideally, you would use a rod with 
                metal eyelets that have ceramic inserts as well, this allows you to use any type of line without worrying about damaging 
                your rod too much.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Terminal tackle you'll need includes strong swivels, lead sinkers (get a variety of sizes between 0.5oz and 8oz), sinker 
                stops (this will prevent your knots from getting destroyed by the lead weight) and sharp hooks. I prefer circle hooks
                personally, most river fishermen do. They're designed to be self setting and provide a solid set in the corner of a fish's
                mouth. They work great for catch and release or for food fishing. For big river catfish, I recommend 8/0 circle hooks.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underline">Be safe</h3>
            <p class="p pb2">
                The last thing I'll talk about is the most important one. Be safe. The big rivers take lives every year, most often 
                from people who fall out of boats or fall into the main channel somehow. It's difficult to swim in the river, especially 
                when the current can carry you for miles and undo any progress towards the shore. There are countless hazards as well,
                from sharp rocks to sucking undercurrents, you don't want to be in the main channel without the proper gear.
                On the bank, you likely will have to deal with steep inclines and muddy shores that can be difficult to escape. Watch for 
                and avoid these areas if they look too steep or muddy. Always use abundant caution when approaching a big river.
                With that out of the way, remember that safe access to the river can offer a wonderful time and be very productive for fishing.
                I hope that didn't scare you off and I hope you find time to pick up a rod and reel and get out on the water!<br><br>
                Best of luck!
