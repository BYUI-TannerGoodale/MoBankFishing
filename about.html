            <p class="p">
                MoRiverBankFishing.com is an affiliate blog designed to fulfill the requirements of a business course I'm taking online.
                My name is Tanner Goodale, I'm the developer, editor and content generator of MoRiverBankFishing.com. I'm an online student at
                BYU-Idaho, living in the heart of Missouri. I believe in full transparency, and in that spirit, I'll explain the purpose
                of this website. A requirement of one of my classes was to build a small web business and I chose the affiliate business model,
                as this was the simplest rout to take. I'm an avid river fishermen, but I also lack a boat of my own, so most of my fishing
                is done on the bank. I figured that I could combine my personal interests with the requirements of my class and present a 
                simple blog type affiliate website populated with information and products that could be used to successfully fish Missouri's
                big rivers (and many other big rivers as well).

                effort to quote and attribute other sources as they come along as well. If you have any intrest in contacting me or wish to inform for
